# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline: incorrect results due to improperly constructed pipeline stages.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected code.

The bug involves an aggregation pipeline that aims to count the occurrences of a field, sort by count and limit the result. However, the pipeline produces incorrect counts due to errors in its stages.

**Bug:**  The provided aggregation pipeline may contain issues in filtering, grouping, sorting, or limiting.  The incorrect results are inconsistent with expected values, highlighting the need for proper pipeline construction.

**Solution:** The solution corrects the pipeline errors by carefully reviewing and adjusting each stage to ensure it correctly performs its intended function. The solution ensures the accurate counting, sorting and limiting of the data.
